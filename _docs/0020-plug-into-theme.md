By default HelpHQ takes over the entire page view. More commonly you'll want to bring along you theme's header and footer for the ride. Dont worry, HelpHQ can be plugged in whereever you'd like.

## Step 1

First we'll need to grab the advanced installation code. Start by heading to the settings page and clicking the advanced settings tab.

Scroll down and copy the advanced installation code.

## Step 3

Create a new page template and paste the code wherever you'd like HelpHQ to appear. Click "Save" once complete.

## Step 4

Head to "Online Store > Pages" and select the HelpHQ Page. Select our newly created template and click save.
