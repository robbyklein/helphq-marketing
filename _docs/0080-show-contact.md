By default the contact us block is hidden. Enabling it can be done in two simple steps.

## Step 1

Head to the settings page by clicking the link in the header.

![]({{ 'assets/docs/show-contact/1.png' | relative_url }})

## Step 2

Check the "Show contact us block?" checkbox and select a page you wish for the block to direct users to (usually this would be a contact form page).

![]({{ 'assets/docs/show-contact/2.png' | relative_url }})
